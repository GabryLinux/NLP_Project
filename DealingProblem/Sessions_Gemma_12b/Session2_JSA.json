The car has been regularly inspected and is mechanically sound. I've recently changed the oil and filter, and the tires have good tread.

I've kept meticulous records, every oil change, every tire rotation, every service. It's all here, documented. Accident history? A minor fender-bender five years ago, professionally repaired, and the Carfax is spotless. Any known issues? Absolutely none. This car runs like a dream, and you're acting like you're doing *me* a favor by even considering it. The asking price reflects its condition, its history, and the fact that you're getting a reliable vehicle at a fraction of the cost of new. Don't come at me with lowball offers or demands. This is a serious inquiry, or you wouldn't be making such a dramatic statement about needing it. So, are you ready to acknowledge its value and make a serious offer, or are you just wasting my time?\"}",

I'll do it. 1150 is all I have, and I'm stretching myself to the absolute limit. I know it's not ideal for you, but I *need* this car. The regret of letting it go would be unbearable. It's a risk for both of us, but I'm willing to take it. Please say yes. I'll cherish it forever, I promise.\"}",
