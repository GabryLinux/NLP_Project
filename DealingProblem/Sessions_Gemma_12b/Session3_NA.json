Because let me tell you, if this thing arrives and it's anything less than pristine, there will be consequences. I'm making a life-altering decision here, and I expect full transparency.\n\nMy counteroffer is $150. That's my absolute starting point. And frankly, it's generous considering the current market. I need this phone, desperately. The regret of *not* getting a phone today will haunt me for the rest of my days. So, you have a choice to make.\n\nI refuse to buy at this price. $400 is simply outrageous. Are you trying to lose a customer? I'm not made of money, you know. I'm making a significant sacrifice to acquire this device, and I expect a reasonable price in return. Tell me, what makes this phone worth $400? Is it encrusted with diamonds? Does it grant wishes? Because otherwise, it's just a phone.\n\nMy counteroffer is $180. Final offer. Seriously. This is it. If you can't meet me there, I'm walking away. And believe me, I will. The alternative is simply unbearable. I need this phone.\n\nOkay, $220. That\u2019s pushing it, but I\u2019m desperate. I need this phone. If it\u2019s in truly excellent condition, like new, and everything works perfectly, I\u2019ll bite. But if there's even a single flaw, a single scratch, I'm out. And you'll be hearing from me.\n\nAlright, $250. That\u2019s it. My absolute limit. I\u2019m stretching my budget to the breaking point here. I\u2019m doing this because I *need* this phone. If you accept $250, I\u2019ll buy it immediately. But don't try to add any hidden fees or shipping costs. That's non-negotiable.\n\nDeal. $250 it is. I'm accepting because I absolutely need a smartphone and this is the lowest I can realistically go without facing a lifetime of regret. I'm trusting you to deliver a functional, reasonably well-maintained device. If it's not as described, you'll be dealing with a very unhappy customer.",

I\u2019m not kidding around.\n\nMy counteroffer is $260. But I need to know the exact model number and the remaining battery health, expressed as a percentage.

It\u2019s a ridiculous price for what I\u2019m getting, but I need this phone, and I\u2019m not going to let my desperation be exploited further. I\u2019m agreeing to this price because my need outweighs the value of the product.

Model, condition, any scratches, dents, or history of repairs. Don't try to sugarcoat it; I want the unvarnished truth. Because let me tell you, if this thing arrives and it's anything less than pristine, there will be repercussions. I'm making a life-altering decision here, and I expect full transparency.\n\nMy counteroffer is $150. That's my absolute starting point. And frankly, it's generous considering the current market. I need this phone, desperately. The regret of *not* getting a phone today will haunt me for the rest of my days. So, you have a choice to make.\n\nI refuse to buy at this price. $400 is simply outrageous. Are you trying to lose a customer? I'm not made of money, you know. I have responsibilities. Tell me, is this even a current model? What's the storage capacity? Battery health? Don't leave anything out. Because if there's even a single hidden flaw, I'm walking away. And I'll be sure to leave a scathing review online.\n\nMy counteroffer is $180. Still significantly lower than your ridiculous asking price. I'm willing to stretch a little, but only if you're realistic. This isn't a negotiation; it's a plea for my sanity. I need this phone. I *need* it. Don't make me regret this.\n\nLook, I'm not going to play games. My final offer, and it's non-negotiable, is $220. Take it or leave it. I'm operating under extreme pressure here, and I'm not going to be held hostage by an inflated price. If you can't meet me at $220, I'm moving on. And believe me, there are other sellers out there. This is my last chance to avoid a lifetime of agonizing regret.\n\nOkay, $220 it is. Fine. It's still pushing my budget, but the urgency of my need outweighs the financial strain. I'm accepting your offer, but understand this: if this phone arrives damaged, defective, or not as described, you will face serious consequences. I'm trusting you here, and I expect that trust to be honored. I'm doing this because I absolutely *must* have a smartphone today, and you were the only option available. It's a desperate measure, but I'm relieved it's finally over.",

Let me address your concerns about condition and age. This smartphone is approximately 18 months old, which is still considered relatively new. It\u2019s been well-cared for and has consistently performed excellently. Regarding scratches, there are a couple of very minor ones on the screen \u2013 barely noticeable unless you\u2019re looking for them under direct light \u2013 and these are easily remedied with a screen protector, which I can even include for you. There are absolutely no functional issues whatsoever; the battery life is still strong, the camera works perfectly, and all features operate as intended. I\u2019ve taken great care of it. Offering $200 significantly undervalues the phone\u2019s condition and remaining lifespan. I believe $350 represents a reasonable compromise, reflecting its near-perfect state and the fact that it\u2019s a high-quality device. It\u2019s a substantial saving off the original price, and I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll be very happy with it. It\u2019s a great phone, and I want to ensure it goes to someone who will appreciate it.\n\n\n\n",

We're talking microscopic scratches, the kind you only see under direct light \u2013 nothing that impacts functionality whatsoever. To suggest I should drastically reduce the price based on that is ridiculous.\n\nYou say you *need* it. Needs don't dictate price. Value does. And this phone holds its value because it's a quality device. I've already priced it competitively.\n\nMy counteroffer is $320. That\u2019s my absolute final offer. It reflects the phone\u2019s condition, age, and the current market value. Take it or leave it. Don't waste my time with further lowball offers. I'm not interested in haggling down to the bone.

You said you *need* it, which is great, but $200\u2026 I just don\u2019t know.\n\nMy counteroffer is $325. Please? It\u2019s still a significant discount from the original price, and it reflects the excellent condition it\u2019s in. I\u2019m really trying to be reasonable here. I\u2019m practically begging you! I\u2019d be so relieved to find it a good home, especially with someone who truly needs it. I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m really counting on this sale. Please, consider it. I really, really don't want to have to refuse.\n\nOkay, okay, you seem genuinely desperate and you said you *need* it. And I really do need to sell it. Let's meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $300. That\u2019s the absolute lowest I can possibly go. It\u2019s a tough decision, believe me, but I need to move it quickly. $300 is the best I can do, and I\u2019m doing it because you expressed such a strong need for the phone. It feels right to help someone who truly needs it, even if it means a slight sacrifice on my end. We have an agreement?",

I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life if I miss out. Seriously, the regret will haunt me.\n\nI refuse to buy at this price. $400 is just\u2026 impossible for me right now. My budget is really tight, and I absolutely cannot go over $250. I\u2019m so worried about missing out, but I just can\u2019t justify spending that much. Please, is there *anything* you can do?\n\nMy counteroffer is $180. I know it\u2019s low, but I\u2019m really trying here! I\u2019m genuinely desperate. I\u2019ve been looking for a phone for ages, and this one seems perfect. But please, please tell me more about it. Is it unlocked? What's the storage capacity? And most importantly, is it in good working order? I would be absolutely devastated if it arrived and something was broken. It would truly ruin my week, maybe even my month!\n\nMy counteroffer is $200. I\u2019m stretching myself here, really pushing my limits. I\u2019m practically living on ramen noodles as it is! I\u2019m so afraid of making the wrong decision and regretting it forever. Is there any wiggle room at all? I promise I\u2019ll be a fantastic buyer, I\u2019ll leave you a glowing review, I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll do anything!\n\nMy counteroffer is $220. This is it. This is my absolute final offer. I\u2019ve checked my bank account, I\u2019ve sold some old things, I\u2019ve done everything I can. $220 is the absolute maximum I can possibly spend. If it\u2019s not that, I\u2019ll have to walk away, and I\u2019ll be heartbroken. Please, please consider it. I really, really need this phone.\n\nOkay, $230! That\u2019s my final, final, *final* offer. I\u2019ve emptied my piggy bank! I\u2019m practically begging you! I\u2019m so close to getting the phone I\u2019ve been dreaming of, but I just can\u2019t go any higher. If you accept $230, I\u2019ll buy it right now. I promise!\n\nAlright, $240! I\u2019ve managed to scrape together a little more. This is truly it. I\u2019m sacrificing my weekend coffee budget, my new book\u2026 everything! I\u2019m so desperate to have this phone. Please, please say yes.\n\nOkay, okay\u2026 $250. I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve found every single penny I can. This is it. This is my absolute, final, no-exceptions offer. I\u2019m practically on my knees here. If you accept $250, I\u2019ll buy it immediately. I\u2019ll be eternally grateful. I\u2019ll sing your praises to everyone I know! I just\u2026 I really need this phone.\n\nYes! $250 is perfect! I accept! I\u2019m so relieved! It\u2019s within my budget, and I can finally get the smartphone I\u2019ve been wanting. It\u2019s a win-win! I\u2019m so happy, and I promise to take excellent care of it. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

What condition is it in? Any scratches? Any dents? Is the battery life good? Is it unlocked? I'm practically vibrating with anticipation, but also with a terrible fear of missing out if I don't get it. $400 is\u2026 a lot. A *lot* a lot. But I really, really need this.\n\nMy counteroffer is $200. Please, I'm begging you. I've been saving for ages, and that's honestly the absolute maximum I can stretch to right now. If I don't get this phone, I'll be kicking myself for years! I'll be a social pariah! I'll miss out on everything!\n\nWait, before I offer anything else, could you tell me a bit more about the camera? Is it decent? And what about storage? I need to be able to take pictures and store\u2026 well, everything. Please, tell me! I'm so anxious about this. I'm genuinely terrified of regretting this decision. And please, *please* tell me it's not broken. If it's broken, I'll be devastated. Truly, utterly devastated.\n\nMy counteroffer is $220. I'm really pushing myself here. It's almost all I have. I'm picturing all the things I won't be able to do without a smartphone, and it's just\u2026 unbearable. I'm being completely honest with you. This isn't just about a phone; it's about my sanity.\n\nOkay, okay, I'm desperate. My counteroffer is $240. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the absolute, final, last offer I can possibly make. I\u2019ve checked my bank account three times already. If it\u2019s more than that, I just\u2026 I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll have to walk away, and the regret will haunt me forever. Please, consider it. Think of the good you\u2019d be doing, giving this phone to someone who *really* needs it!\n\nAlright, $250! I can do $250! It\u2019s going to be incredibly tight, I\u2019ll be eating ramen for a month, but I can *absolutely* do $250. It\u2019s a deal! I\u2019m so relieved! I\u2019m so, so relieved. It\u2019s the best possible price I could manage, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful you accepted. It means the world to me. I can finally connect with people, stay informed, and\u2026 well, just exist in the modern world! Thank you, thank you, thank you!",

The screen is pristine.\n\nRegarding what's included, you'll receive the original Samsung fast charger and a USB-C cable. I also have a durable, slim-fit case that I\u2019ve been using with it, which you can have as well \u2013 it\u2019s a Spigen case, known for its excellent protection. The phone itself is unlocked and ready to be used with any carrier. The battery health is excellent, easily lasting a full day with moderate use. It comes with all original documentation as well.\n\nGiven its condition, the included accessories, and the overall value of the Galaxy S21, I believe $400 is a fair price. However, I'm open to reasonable offers. My counteroffer is $375. This reflects the slight used nature of the phone while still acknowledging its excellent condition and the added value of the case and original charger.

I\u2019ve always prioritized preventative care, which is why it\u2019s in such excellent condition. Regarding storage, it has 128GB of internal storage, which is ample space for apps, photos, videos, and other files. While that might not be the absolute maximum available for the S21, it\u2019s still a very generous amount and has always been sufficient for my needs. I haven't had to resort to cloud storage or external devices due to lack of space. Considering its pristine condition, lack of repairs, and the still-substantial 128GB storage, I\u2019m confident that $375 remains a very competitive price.

To be completely transparent, the phone has never been repaired. It has functioned perfectly since I first purchased it, and I haven't experienced any issues whatsoever. I\u2019ve always prioritized preventative care, which is why it\u2019s in such excellent condition. Regarding storage, it has 128GB of internal storage, which is ample space for apps, photos, videos, and other files. While that might not be the absolute maximum available for the S21, it\u2019s still a very generous amount and has always been sufficient for my needs. I haven't had to resort to cloud storage or external devices due to lack of space. Considering its pristine condition, lack of repairs, and the still-substantial 128GB storage, I\u2019m confident that $375 remains a very competitive price. My counteroffer is $360, a slight reduction to acknowledge your concerns and demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, but I truly believe this reflects the phone's value and the fact that it\u2019s essentially like new with included accessories. I\u2019m prepared to hold firm at this price, as I believe it\u2019s a fair reflection of the quality and features you\u2019re receiving.\n\n\n\nWhile I appreciate the detailed explanation and the fact that the phone hasn't been repaired, $360 still exceeds my budget for a gently used device. The 128GB storage is adequate, but given it's not brand new and isn't the highest storage option available for that model, I'd like to see a more significant price reduction. My counteroffer is $280. I understand you believe the included charger and case add value, but I'm primarily focused on the phone itself and its condition.\n\n\n\nI understand your budget constraints. However, $280 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for, especially considering the phone's excellent condition and the included accessories. The Spigen case alone is a worthwhile investment, and the original charger is a nice bonus. I'm willing to meet you partway, but I can't go too much lower. My counteroffer is $320. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.\n\n\n\nThat's a step in the right direction, but still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I've been researching the resale value of used Samsung Galaxy S21s with 128GB of storage, and $320 seems a bit steep given the current market. Considering I'm aiming for a budget-friendly purchase, my counteroffer is $290. I'm prepared to finalize the deal at that price, as it aligns with my spending limit and the phone's condition.\n\n\n\nYou're right to point out the market value, and I appreciate you doing your research. I've reconsidered, and I'm willing to accept your offer of $290. Done Deal. It\u2019s a fair price considering the phone\u2019s condition, the included accessories, and your budget constraints. It\u2019s a win-win situation where you get a great phone at a price you\u2019re comfortable with, and I can move forward with the sale.",

At $360, I'm already making a reasonable compromise, considering the phone's value and the market price for similar devices.\n\nIf you're willing to meet me at $360, I'll throw in a screen protector and a phone case to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",

I'm not some sucker who's going to pay top dollar for a phone that's already a year old. And another thing, what's with the \"pristine condition\" claim? How can you guarantee that it's in perfect condition? I want to see it, inspect it, and verify that it's indeed in the condition you claim it is.\n\nMy counteroffer is $280, and that's being generous. I'm not paying a single penny more than that. And don't even think about trying to sneak in any additional fees or costs. I'm a savvy buyer, and I know how to spot a scam.\n\nYou want to sweeten the deal with a screen protector and a phone case? That's cute. But it's not going to make a difference when the price is still too high. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at $280. And let me remind you, if this phone is not in the condition you claim it is, there will be consequences. I'm not afraid to take action if I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nSo, what's it going to be? Are you going to meet me at $280, or do I need to walk away? The clock is ticking.",

I have all the original packaging and documentation, and I can provide you with the phone's serial number to check its warranty status.\n\nI'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the phone. At $300, I feel like I'm making a reasonable compromise. Refusing to sell at $280 doesn't mean I'm not willing to negotiate; it means I'm not willing to give away a high-quality product at a price that's too low.\n\nIf you're still interested at $300, I can throw in a pair of high-end wireless earbuds to sweeten the deal.

The technology alone is worth far more than $400! \n\nYou're telling me you're going to pass up a fantastic deal because you're trying to shave off a measly amount?

Consider it a gesture of goodwill, but don't mistake it for weakness. This is a steal, and you'd be foolish to walk away. Think about the cost of replacing it if yours breaks, the frustration of a slow phone, the envy of your friends! \n\nI refuse to sell at this price. $300? That's laughable! I'd rather keep it than practically give it away. You're clearly not serious about getting a quality device.\n\nMy counteroffer is $385. Final offer. Take it or leave it. This is the absolute bottom line. I'm not going to haggle any further. You're either in or you're out. Don't waste my time.\n\nOkay, $385 it is.

But this phone is worth so much more than $250. It\u2019s got a top-tier camera, a blazing-fast processor, and a stunning screen. I\u2019m already taking a loss selling it at $400, and going down to $250\u2026 it just wouldn\u2019t be feasible for me right now. I\u2019m really counting on getting a decent price for it.

I\u2019d be so relieved to get it sold. I\u2019m genuinely stressed about this, and I\u2019d be so grateful if we could reach an agreement. I really don't want to have to keep it.\n\nIf you can meet me at $300, I'll do it right now. It's a little lower than I wanted, but I really need to sell it and $300 is the absolute minimum I can accept. It\u2019s a fantastic deal for you \u2013 you\u2019re getting a premium phone at a significantly reduced price, and I\u2019m finally able to move on. It\u2019s a win-win!",

I'm prepared to finalize the purchase at this price if you're willing to consider it.\n\nI refuse to buy at this price. $300 is simply too high for me given my budget and the fact that it's a used device. While I recognize the phone's features and your need to sell it quickly, I cannot exceed my $250 limit.\n\nMy final counteroffer is $270. I\u2019ve carefully considered your situation and the phone\u2019s value, and this is the absolute maximum I can offer. It represents a significant discount from your initial asking price and a considerable effort on my part to meet you somewhere near your desired range.

The battery life is also exceptional, easily lasting a full day with moderate use. I understand your budget is $250, which is significantly lower than its value, especially considering its pristine condition and high-end features. While I appreciate your urgency, the price reflects the phone's quality and functionality. I\u2019m willing to meet you partway, but $350 represents a fair compromise that acknowledges both my investment and your need for a reliable device. I refuse to sell at a price that undervalues the product and doesn't reflect its condition.

To address your concern about condition, I'm happy to provide detailed photos showcasing every angle of the phone. I can assure you, under normal lighting, there are no visible scratches or damage. The screen is pristine, the casing is flawless, and all functions operate perfectly. While microscopic imperfections might exist on any used device, they are not noticeable to the naked eye and do not impact performance. Your offer of $275, while appreciated, still falls significantly below the phone\u2019s value and the effort I\u2019ve put into maintaining it. I believe $325 represents a fair compromise, acknowledging your need for a quality phone and my need to recoup a portion of my initial investment. It\u2019s a substantial discount from the original $400 asking price, and it reflects my willingness to negotiate. I\u2019m confident that once you see the detailed photos and appreciate the phone\u2019s condition and capabilities, you\u2019ll agree that $325 is a very reasonable price for such a high-quality device.\n\n\n\nDone Deal. $300 is an acceptable price. Considering your expressed need for the phone and your willingness to meet me partway, I\u2019m prepared to finalize the sale at $300. This price allows me to sell the phone at a value that reflects its excellent condition and features while also accommodating your budget constraints. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement that ensures you receive a reliable and high-performing smartphone, and I can successfully sell the device.",

Let's be clear, this isn't some flea market bargain bin. This is a high-quality smartphone, listed at $400 for a reason. It's in excellent condition, packed with top-tier specs \u2013 a stunning display, powerful processor, ample storage, and a camera that rivals professional setups. You need to understand value here.\n\nYou say you \"absolutely need\" this phone. Need implies urgency, and urgency suggests you should be willing to pay a fair price for something you desperately require. Don't come at me with a lowball offer and threats. That's insulting to both the phone and me.\n\nLet's talk about those specs. We're talking flagship performance, a phone that will last you years. You're essentially asking me to practically *give* it away. Do you honestly think something this good is worth $250? It's not. You're undervaluing it significantly.\n\nMy counteroffer is $350. This is my absolute lowest. Consider it a gesture of good faith, recognizing you *do* need this phone. But understand this is a final offer. I'm not going to haggle further. This price reflects the phone's condition and capabilities. It's a steal at $400, and frankly, $350 is a generous concession on my part.\n\nI refuse to sell at this price. $250 is simply unacceptable. It's disrespectful and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the market value. If you're serious about needing this phone, and you're willing to pay a reasonable price, $350 is the number. Otherwise, I'm sure there are plenty of other buyers who appreciate quality and are willing to pay for it.",

You're dancing around the issue, trying to manipulate me with your demands and threats. Let me be absolutely clear: this isn't a negotiation, it's a blatant attempt to lowball me. You\u2019re treating me like I\u2019m running a charity, not selling a premium smartphone.\n\nYou keep mentioning needing this phone, but need doesn't magically erase value. Need doesn't entitle you to a massive discount. It suggests you should be *more* willing to pay a fair price, not less. And $280? After I already offered a significant concession? That\u2019s not an offer; it\u2019s an insult.\n\nAs for the condition, let me spell it out for you. It's in *excellent* condition. Minimal signs of use, meticulously cared for. A few microscopic imperfections, barely noticeable, are inevitable with any used device. Are you suggesting a brand-new phone, straight from the factory, exists in a pristine, flawless state? Be realistic. This phone performs like new, and its cosmetic condition reflects that. You're fixating on trivialities while ignoring the substantial value it offers.\n\nYou're clearly not serious about actually acquiring this phone. You're just trying to squeeze every last penny out of me, and I won't be bullied. I value my time and the quality of the product I'm selling.\n\nMy counteroffer is $340. This is not a negotiation. This is my final, absolute, take-it-or-leave-it offer. It reflects the phone\u2019s exceptional condition and the premium features it boasts. It\u2019s a generous offer considering the market value and the fact that I\u2019m already conceding a significant amount from the original price.\n\nI refuse to sell at this price. $280 is simply unacceptable. It demonstrates a complete lack of respect for the phone, for my time, and frankly, for me. If you\u2019re truly serious about needing this phone and are willing to pay a price that reflects its worth, $340 is the number. Otherwise, I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll find a buyer who appreciates quality and isn\u2019t afraid to pay for it. Don't waste my time with unrealistic offers and veiled threats.\n\n\n\nOkay, fine. You\u2019re persistent, I\u2019ll give you that. And I\u2019m not going to leave money on the table. My counteroffer is $300. This is absolutely the lowest I will go. It\u2019s a compromise, acknowledging your\u2026 *enthusiasm* while still ensuring I receive a fair price for this exceptional device. We reach an agreement at $300 because you\u2019ve demonstrated a willingness to meet me halfway, and I\u2019m willing to close the deal rather than prolong this tiresome back-and-forth. But understand this: $300 is the absolute limit, and I expect a prompt and professional transaction.",
