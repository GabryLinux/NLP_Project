This is a 55-inch LG 4K Smart TV, model number OLED55C2PUA, which currently retails for around $1200.

It includes all the latest smart features \u2013 built-in Google Assistant and Alexa, webOS 22 for seamless app access, and supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for a truly cinematic experience.

Honestly, I\u2019m starting to regret even putting it up for sale. I had hoped for at least $700, but I thought $600 was a fair compromise. I\u2019ve put so much care into this, it\u2019s been treated like a member of the family! \n\nI refuse to sell at this price. It\u2019s simply\u2026 unthinkable. I\u2019d rather keep it, honestly. It\u2019s a beautiful piece of technology. But I *need* to sell it. Please, meet me halfway. Think of the movies, the games, the sheer *joy* this TV will bring!\n\n\n\nMy counteroffer is $550. Please, please consider it. I\u2019m really starting to panic here.",

Regarding blemishes or issues, I want to be completely transparent: the TV is in excellent condition with no dead pixels, screen damage, or functional problems. There are no noticeable scratches or marks on the screen or the casing. It has been carefully used and well-maintained. I am reducing the price to $400 as a final attempt to reach an agreement, recognizing your stated need for the television.

I\u2019ve already reduced the price significantly from the original $600, and further reductions would result in a loss that I\u2019m not willing to accept. I understand you believe it\u2019s a fantastic deal for both of us at $365, but a deal needs to be mutually beneficial, and that price doesn\u2019t meet my minimum requirement. $450 represents a compromise \u2013 it\u2019s lower than my initial asking price, but it still acknowledges the TV\u2019s value as a 4K smart TV in pristine condition. It allows me to recoup a reasonable amount of my initial investment while still offering you a high-quality television at a competitive price.

It truly is a fantastic piece of technology, offering stunning picture quality and seamless access to all your favorite streaming services. Given your\u2026 passionate need, and acknowledging the current market, I\u2019m willing to come down, but not drastically. I value the TV at $600 due to its condition and features. However, recognizing your situation, and wanting to facilitate a sale, my counteroffer is $525. This is significantly below the market value, but I\u2019m hoping to find a reasonable middle ground. I believe $525 represents a fair price for both of us, considering the TV\u2019s quality and the warranty included.

A flawless, top-of-the-line Sony 4K television, ready to deliver an unparalleled viewing experience.\n\nYour counteroffer of $485 is\u2026 frankly, insulting. It demonstrates a complete disregard for the value I\u2019m offering. You\u2019re attempting to exploit a seller, preying on some imagined desperation. Let me assure you, I am not desperate. I am confident in my product and its worth.\n\nI refuse to sell at this price. $485 doesn\u2019t even begin to cover the cost of replacement should anything happen to it, and I\u2019m not willing to take that risk. \n\nMy counteroffer is $525. And that is absolutely, unequivocally, the lowest I will go. I\u2019m already making a significant concession by even considering offers below $600. Think carefully. You\u2019re on the verge of securing a phenomenal television at a price that still represents excellent value. Don\u2019t squander this opportunity with further lowball offers. This is your last chance to avoid disappointment.\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m practically offering you a kidney at this point!\n\nLook, I understand you\u2019re confident in your product. You\u2019ve made that abundantly clear. But confidence doesn\u2019t pay my rent!

My absolute, final, take-it-or-leave-it, last-gasp, desperate plea. $500, and I will happily, gratefully, and eternally thank you for saving my weekend, my happiness, and possibly my life. I refuse to go a penny higher. I simply cannot. I will regret it forever, but I *will* regret it less than being financially crippled by a television.\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s almost\u2026 beautiful.\n\nI\u2019ve been on an emotional rollercoaster, teetering on the brink of despair, and you\u2019ve held firm, a stoic bastion of market value.
