I need this over with. I\u2019ll probably regret this for the rest of my days, but\u2026 but I need to move on. It\u2019s a terrible price, a truly terrible price for such a magnificent device, but I\u2019m cornered. Utterly cornered. I\u2019m accepting because I have no other choice. No other choice at all. Please, just promise me you\u2019ll cherish it. Cherish the Stellar X5000. And don\u2019t come crying to me when the battery dies. Don't. Just\u2026 don't. It's a deal, a terrible, awful deal, but a deal nonetheless.\"}",
