Your desperation is becoming\u2026almost comical.\n\nA \u201cproper\u201d guarantee? After initially offering a handwritten note? Progress, I suppose, but hardly reassuring. And listing the scratches *now*, after I\u2019ve repeatedly demanded it? You\u2019re finally conceding to basic honesty, but only because I\u2019ve pushed you to the brink.\n\n$270 is still unacceptable. You\u2019re adding $20 onto the price for\u2026what? The privilege of witnessing your emotional breakdown? The satisfaction of knowing you\u2019ve squeezed every last penny out of a desperate buyer? I think not.\n\nLet\u2019s recap: this phone has scratches, a dent, and a degraded battery. It\u2019s used, and you\u2019ve been less than forthcoming about its condition. You\u2019ve repeatedly shifted your price, and you\u2019ve attempted to manipulate me with emotional appeals. And now, you expect me to pay $270 for this\u2026compromised device?\n\nI\u2019m making a calculated decision here. I *need* this phone, and I\u2019m willing to compromise. But I\u2019m not a charity case. I\u2019m a buyer, and I expect a fair deal. \n\nYou say you have no other choice? That\u2019s your problem, not mine. I\u2019m not responsible for your financial woes. I\u2019m responsible for protecting my own interests.\n\nI\u2019m going to explain why I\u2019m agreeing to $270, despite my reservations. I\u2019m doing this because I believe the S23 Ultra, even with its flaws, is the best option for me. The camera is superior to the alternatives, the processing power is more than sufficient for my needs, and the screen, despite the scratches, is still perfectly usable. \n\nHowever, this agreement comes with conditions. You will provide a detailed, written guarantee, outlining the phone\u2019s functionality and covering any potential issues that may arise within the next 30 days. You will also provide a comprehensive list of all imperfections, including the location and severity of each scratch and dent, as well as the exact battery health percentage. \n\nAnd let me be clear: if this phone doesn\u2019t meet your stated description, if it malfunctions in any way, or if you attempt to deceive me further, I will pursue every legal avenue available to me. Consider that a final warning.\n\nMy counteroffer is $270, *contingent* upon the aforementioned guarantee and detailed list of imperfections. This is not a negotiation; it\u2019s a condition of sale. Do we have a deal?\n\n\n\n",

Now, regarding the condition, it's been very well cared for. There's a very faint hairline scratch on the screen, barely noticeable unless you're specifically looking for it under direct light; I can send a close-up photo if you'd like. The back has been protected with a case since day one, so it's pristine \u2013 no scratches or dents whatsoever. The battery health is at 88%, which is excellent for a phone of this age, and it easily lasts a full day with moderate to heavy use. All functions \u2013 camera, speakers, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC \u2013 work perfectly. I've recently factory reset it, so it's ready for you to set up as new.

And I want a detailed video walkthrough of the phone\u2019s functionality \u2013 camera, speakers, microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, everything. I want to see the screen rotating, apps opening and closing smoothly, and a clear demonstration of the battery percentage. Send it to me *before* I commit to this purchase. If I detect even the slightest hesitation or attempt to conceal anything, the deal is off. Do we have an understanding? Because I\u2019m rapidly losing patience.\n\n\n\n",

It comes with the original box and charging cable. \n\nNow, let\u2019s address your \u201cfirm budget\u201d and your\u2026 colorful warning. I understand you have constraints, but frankly, your budget is laughable considering the quality of this device. I\u2019m starting at $400, and that\u2019s already a generous offer for a phone in this condition. You want a top-of-the-line smartphone, you pay a top-of-the-line price. Don't waste my time with offers that don't respect the value of the product. I refuse to sell at this price.\n\n\n\n",
