This TV is a top-of-the-line model, with features that far surpass anything you'll find in the $450-$500 range. It's got a 4K resolution, HDR, and a wide color gamut that will make your viewing experience like nothing you've ever seen before. And let's not forget the smart features - it's got all the latest streaming apps, voice control, and a seamless user interface that makes it a joy to use.\n\nAs for what sets it apart from other models in its class, let me tell you - this TV has a unique panel design that reduces glare and provides a more immersive viewing experience. It's also got a built-in sound system that's far superior to anything you'll find in a budget TV. And with its sleek and slim design, it's perfect for any living room or home theater.\n\nSo, I'm not interested in negotiating the price down to $450-$500. That's not even close to what this TV is worth. If you want to buy it, you're going to have to pay the price I'm asking - $600. Anything less and I'm not making a sale.",

I\u2019ve had to take out a small loan just to even consider this, and it\u2019s a huge strain.
