It's just a few months old, barely used, and looks like it just came out of the box. The screen is flawless, no scratches, no cracks, nothing. The body is also in perfect shape, no dents, no dings, it's like new. \n\nThe features? Where do I even start? This phone has a stunning 6.7-inch AMOLED display, perfect for watching videos or browsing the web. It's powered by a fast charging 4500mAh battery that lasts all day and then some. The camera? Unbeatable. A quad-camera setup with a 50MP primary sensor, 12MP front camera, and advanced features like optical zoom, portrait mode, and AI-enhanced image processing. And let's not forget the processor - a lightning-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. \n\nI'm not just selling a phone here, I'm selling an experience. This phone can handle anything you throw at it - gaming, video editing, multitasking, you name it. And with its advanced security features, including facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, you can rest assured your data is safe.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Is it worth $400?\" And my answer is, absolutely. I've done my research, and similar models are selling for much higher than that. But I'm not looking to make a quick buck, I'm looking for a fair price for a fair product. And let's be real, this phone is a steal at $400. \n\nI refuse to sell at any price lower than $400, I simply can't afford to part with it for less. I've already had offers of $350, and I had to politely decline. My bottom line is $400, and I'm not budging. My desperation to sell it at this price stems from the fact that I've got bills to pay, and I really need the money. I'm counting on selling this phone at $400 to get back on my feet.",

I've already told you, my bottom line is $400, and I'm not moving from that. \n\nYou think $260 is a fair price? Have you seen the market value of this phone? It's a flagship model, one of the best on the market, and you're offering me less than a third of its actual worth? I think you're not taking into account the phone's condition, the rarity of the model, and the fact that it's barely used. \n\nI'm not desperate to sell, I'm desperate to sell at a fair price. And a fair price for this phone is $400. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, then I'm afraid we can't do business. I have other offers, from people who are willing to pay a reasonable price for a phone that's worth every penny of $400. \n\nMy counteroffer is $400, and it's not negotiable.

Halfway between $260 and $400 would be $330. I'm not even getting close to my bottom line with your proposal. I'm still being asked to give up $120 from the price I consider fair.\n\nThis phone is not just any phone, it's a high-end device with cutting-edge features and exceptional condition. I've taken good care of it, and it shows. The battery life is still excellent, and the cameras are still producing stunning images. \n\nI refuse to sell at $280.

I have other interested buyers who are willing to pay the price I'm asking, and I won't let this opportunity slip away. \n\nConsider this: you're getting a practically new phone, with all the features and warranty that comes with it. You're getting an exceptional deal, but you have to be willing to pay a fair price for it. $400 is not too much to ask, it's a bargain for a phone of this quality.",

I've had it for about a year, and I've used it for work and personal purposes. I've taken good care of it, and I've kept it in a protective case at all times.\n\nAs for scratches or dents, I can assure you that there are none. The phone's screen is pristine, and the body is free of any significant marks.
